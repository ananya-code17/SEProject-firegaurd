# SEProject-firegaurd
This is a project on FireGuard, a software tool designed to predict the long-term economic impact of wildfires. The system analyzes key factors such as fire intensity, duration, and regional dependencies to provide actionable insights for disaster recovery planning and resource allocation. The software features an intuitive web interface where users can input wildfire data, view predictions through interactive graphs and maps, and receive recovery recommendations. FireGuardâ€™s machine-learning-powered backend enables precise forecasting of economic losses and recovery timelines, assisting stakeholders in informed decision-making and report generation for effective wildfire management.
